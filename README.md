# INEFinal
This is the excel final project for the honors course Engineering Economy. It is very complex and deals with the financial reports and decisions related to a project we came up with. Half of it was done by me and the other half by my colleague Mohamad Harb.
The file contains a powerpoint to explain and the excel file.
